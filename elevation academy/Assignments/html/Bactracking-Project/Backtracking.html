    <h1>Back Tracking</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <br>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After make
        your choice you will get a new set of options;
        just what set of options you got depends on what choice you made. The procedure is repeated over and over until
        you reachea final state. If you made aa good sequence of choice, your fial state; if you didn't, it isn't.
        <br>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and same bad leaves,
        though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a
        leaf.
        <br>
        Suppose you get to a bad leafe. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most
        recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the
        choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left,
        there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <img src="./Image_root.png" alt="root image" width="250px">
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>

    <h2>The Backtracking Algorithm.</h2>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node{
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n{
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solveble, then n is not solvable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable(part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is
        test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this
        is done by the lines</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        for each child c of n{
            if solve(c)succeeds, return true
        }
        return false
    </pre>
    <p>Eventually the recurssion will "buttom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if
        the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This our base case. In the above code, this is done by the
        lines </p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }
    </pre>
    <p> The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating
        it is as follow:</p>
    <h3>To search a tree:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>If the consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees, until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them
            all unsuccessfully.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
    <p> Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
        algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine language.</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        boolean solve(Node n) {
         put node n on the stack:
          while the stack is not empty{
           if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
            else pop it off the stack
           }
            else{
                if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                   push the next untried child onto the stack
            }
            return false
          }
        
      </pre>
    <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently
        on the top of stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all
        times describe valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no
        goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed(making the stack empty), there must
        have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.</p>
    <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack from(in reverse order) a path from the
        root to a goal nodes.</p>
    <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds goal node, the path information is embodied(in reverse order)in the
        sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by
        (for instance) printing the node at current level, or storing it in an array. </p>
    <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the
        successful path:</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        boolean solve(Node n){
            if n is a leaf node{
                if the leaf is a goal node{
                    print n  
                    return true
                }
                else return false 
            } else{
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c)succeeds{
                        print n 
                        return true
                    }
                }
                return false 
            }
        }
      </pre>
    <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
    <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorith are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they
        can get pretty cluttered upwith details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:</p>
    <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate
        and salemate solutions </p>
    <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buired in methods. In a chess game, for example,
        you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it
        <b>isLeaf)</b>. this method encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
    </p>
    <p>Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its
        children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look
        simple, by just saying <b>for each child c of n. </b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the
        possible children are, and there may be obvius way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can
        represent one arrangement of pieces on chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement
        after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones
        you've already examined?</p>
    <p>The most straightforword way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: upon
        initial entry to the node(that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you
        try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you
        can return"failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.</p>
    <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the
        chidren. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try
        next.</p>
    <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then,
        if you have just tried <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1</b>, and
        you not yet tried children <b>k+1</b>through <b>n.</b>Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four
        colors, you can always try <b>red first then green, then blue.</b> If child yelllow fails, you know to try child
        green next. If you are searching maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <b>(or perhaps
            north, east, south, west).</b></p>
    <h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will
        also sue the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.</p>
    <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can
        reference (point to) zero, one or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are reffered to
        as the left child and/ or the right child. All nodes are reacheble (by one or moresteps) from the root node, and
        there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say
        that a node might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we
        repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p>
    <p>Here's definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        public class BinaryTree {
            BinaryTree leftChild = null;
            BinaryTree rightChild = null;
            boolean isGoalNode = false;
            String name;

            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                this.name = name;
                leftChild = left;
                rightChild = right;
                this.is GoalNode = isGoalNode;
            }
        }
      </pre>
    <p>Next we will create TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above
        binary tree.</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        Static BinaryTree makeTree() {
            BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
            c = new BinaryTree("C", null,null,false);
            d = new BinaryTree("D", null,null,false);
            e = new BinaryTree("E", null,null,false);
            f = new BinaryTree("F", null,null,false);
            a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d,false);
            b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
            root = new BinaryTree("Root",a, b, false);
            return root;
        }
      </pre>
    <p>Here's main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        public boolean static void main(String args[]){
            BinaryTree tree=makeTree();
            System.out.println(solvable(tree));
        }
      </pre>
    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node
    </p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
            /*1*/ if (node==null)return false;
            /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode)return true;
            /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild))return true;
            /*4*/ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
            /*5*/ return false;
        }
      </pre>
    <p>Here's what the nubered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol types="1">
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the
            children of a node, without first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
        <li>If the node we are giving is a goal node, return success.</li>
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to
            this line if node is non-null and is not a goal node ,says to </li>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening results true</p>
    <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first
        thing in solvable. An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do.
        here's that alternative version:</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
            if (node.isGoalNode)return true;
            if (node.leftChild !=null&& solvable(node.leftChild))return true;
            if (node.rightChild !=null&& solvable(node.rightChild))return true;
            return false;
        }

      </pre>
    <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
    <h2>What are the children?</h2>
    <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all
        the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as
        you know, both are left and right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to
        eliminate children immediately, without recursion.</p>
    <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a
        plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two
        countries that share a border are the same color.</p>
    <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until
        all countries are colored.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to do this.</p>
    <ol type="desc">
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors , and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you
            are at a, goal node.</li>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for a </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard. This should be easly solvable;
        after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
    <br>
    <b>boolean mapIsOK()</b>
    <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly</p>
    <br>
    <b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b>
    <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
    </p>
    <b> int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b>
    <p>Used by both methods to find the next "Country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the
        checkerboard)</p>
    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        boolean explore1(int row, int column,int color) {
            if (row>=NUM_ROWS)return maplsOK();
            map[row][column]=color;
            for (int nextColor=RED;nextColor<=BLUE; nextColor++) {
                int[] next=nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
                if (explore1(next[0],nextColor)) return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
      </pre>
    <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        boolean explore2(int row,int column, int color){
            if(row>=NUM_ROWS)return true;
            if (okToColor(row,column,color)){
                map[row][column]=color;
                for (int nextColor-RED;nextColor<=BLUE;nextColor++) {
                    int[] next=nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
                    if(explore2(next[0],next[1],nextColor)) return true;
                }
            }
            return false
        }     
     </pre>
    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests
        otherwise:</p>
    <center>
        <style>

        </table>
    </center>
    <p> The zeros in the above table indicate times to measure(less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference?
        Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Elimination a node automatically eliminates all of its
        descendents, and this well often prevent exponential growth. Coversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is
        reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set
        of choice), do so!</p>
    <h2>Debugging techiniques</h2>
    <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we
        need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print
        statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you arre trying to debug
        recursive routines.</p>
    <h3>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h3>
    <p>Often,the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important
        ones). Yu probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves
        with.However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their
        corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p>
    <h3>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h3>
    <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also ,remember that code inserted for debugging purposees
        can itself contain bugs, or (in thw worst case) can affect the results, so be carefull with it.</p>
    <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in
        larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        static String indent ="";

        static String name(BinaryTree node){
            if(node==null)return null;

        static boolean no(BinaryTree node){
            indent = indent.subtring(3);
            System.out.println(indent + "solvable("name(node)+")return false");
            return false;

    <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        Static boolean solvable (BinaryTree node){
            enter(node);
            if (node == null)return no(node);
            if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
            if (solvable(node.rightChild))return yes(node);
            return no(node);
        }
     </pre>
    <p>And we get these results:</p>

        Entering solvable(Root)
        | Entering solvable(A)

    <h3>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
    <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it
        to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?</p>
    <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or
        to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's
        more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every
        return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.</p>
    <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statement conditional. For example,</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        static final boolean debugging = false;

        static void enter(BinaryTree node){
            if(debugging){
                if (debugging){
                    System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node)+")");
                    indent = indent+"| ";

                }
            }
            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
                if (debugging){
                    indent = indent.substring(3);
                    System.out.println(indent +"solvable( " +name(node)+ ")returns false");
                }
                return false;
        }
     </pre>
    <p>In industry,actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too
        much about making your code larger; modren compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it
        can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.</p>
    <h3>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>
    <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about where it happend by sending it the message
        printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own
        Exceptions. However, Java programers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it.
        For Example, the following</p>
    <pre>new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre>
    <p>Will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above
        code just act like a print statement.</p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        java.lang.Exception:Checkpoint Charlie
        at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:53)
        at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:57)

    <h5>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up).
        At each move, a marble can either:</h5>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
        <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear</li>

    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we
        are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p>
    <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to
        attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it
        will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.</p>
    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we
        are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p>
    <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the
        current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find
        the possible moves from that node.Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these
        possible moves.</p>
    <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a
        number of appoaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program
        this puzzle, you might find a different but equality valid approach.</p>
    <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot
        jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might
        assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have
        looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or
        else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want.
        Neither alternative is very attractive.</p>
    <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking
        about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is
        possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in
        that space has move, it is unique. there is slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but
        at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p>
    <h5> Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the
        board. For each space,either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean
        method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
    </h5>
    <ul type=" disc">
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a balck marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard,int position)</b> that will take a board and a
        posiotion, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat
        more efficientls by changing the old board, rather that creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with
        simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."</p>
    <p>Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b>puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings
        that should be obvious. </p>
    <pre style="color:rebeccapurple">
        boolean solvable(int[] board){
            if (puzzleSolved(board)){
                return true;
            }
            for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++){
             if (canMove(board,position))  {
                int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position);

        the dlast line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking
        always produces its results (sequence of choice) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse
        the results again to get them in the correct order.</P>
